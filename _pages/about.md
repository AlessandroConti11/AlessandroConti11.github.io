<h3>A passionate backend developer from Italy</h3>

I'm a MSc student in computer science and engineering at the Politecnico of Milan.
I am very passionate about cyber-security, operating systems, software development, and generally all free and open source software.

I am comfortable working in teams and collaborating with passionate people.
